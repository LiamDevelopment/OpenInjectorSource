# Open Injector
The open injector is lightweight, easy-to-use and adjustable for different things. The open injector is an open source project for anyone to collaborate with. This injector is using InjectionLibrary, coded by Jason in C#. Rest of the injector is coded with .NET for speeding up the coding process.
